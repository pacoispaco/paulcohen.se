This post is the first in a series which I call “The flat earth posts”. In each post I discuss a commonly held truth which is a) untrue, b) hinders progress and c) causes unecessary work.

Many organizations force their users to change their passwords every 3 months or according to some other regular schedule. This policy is based on a standard security policy recommendation that has been around for a long time and which is seldom questioned. Proponents of this security policy recommendation say that changing passwords improves security.

In fact, forcing users to change passwords on a regular schedule degrades security and causes dissatisfaction in your organization. Here are some of the effects of this policy:

* Users start writing down passwords (bad for security).
* Users loose time and get locked out of accounts (bad for productivity).
* Users get irritated (bad for motivation).
* Users phone the IT support help desk to recover accounts they’ve been locked out from (increased help desk work).

The only time it is appropriate to force users to change their passwords is when you know or think their accounts have been compromised.
