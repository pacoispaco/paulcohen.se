As part of my decision to start recording birds this year, I also decided to try
start recording migrating birds over my apartment in central Stockholm. Yeah, I
know I should have better things to do, but this is fun. Bear with me! This
summer I bought a small [Sony PCM A10](https://www.sony.co.uk/electronics/voice-recorders/pcm-a10)
recorder, which I think is an excellent lightweight recorder, to have with me
in the field. In mid July I started to leave it outside my window over the night,
recording for the entire night. I have been doing it regularly since then every 2
to 4 nights.

**Figure 1**. The view from my study room window, outside of which I place
my recorder.

The cult of listening to and recording night migration of birds is called
_nocmig_, which is short for _nocturnal migration_ and the act of doing it
can be called _nocmigging_. It sounds a bit suspect and nothing you would want
talk about with your friends, with police officers around. But Nocmigging is
not only fun and legal, it is also an excellent way to sharpen your skills in
identifying bird calls and enjoing the magic of bird migration.

The day after a nightly recording, I import the recording into the sound
editing program [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/), and then visually
browse through it, looking at one thirty-second window of the sonogram at a
time. It takes about half an hour to an hour to browse through an eight hour
recording. When I see an interesting pattern in the sonogram, I listen to what
is recorded and try to identify the sound that produced the sonogram pattern.

In the beginning I listened a lot to cars, human voices, squeeky doors and bikes
as well as the odd drunkard or boisterous gang of urban hipsters. But quite
quickly, I got good at visually sorting out the normal urban noises from bird
calls in the sonogram patterns. And just as quickly I started to be good at
recognizing the sonogram signatures of common birds like Blackbirds (Koltrast),
_Turdus merula_, Swifts (Tornseglare), _Apus apus_ and Blue tits (Blåmes),
_Cyanistes caeruleus_. Then I started noticing other patterns, such as the time
in the morning when different species start getting active, but also, as the
weeks passed by, that some species started disappearing from the recordings,
like Swifts in late August. And Baltic Lesser black-backed gulls (Silltrut),
_Larus fuscus_, that start migrating south in late September to the Arabian
peninsular, where they spend the winter.

**Figure 2**. The sonogram, as produced in Audacity, of a Brambling (Bergfink),
_Fringilla montifringilla_, recorded at 06:28 on September 28, 2020. It probably
took a rest on our roof top, on its migratory voyage south!

As summer turned into autumn some of the summer birds disappeared, but in late
August, migrating White wagtails (Sädesärla), _Motacilla alba_, Meadow pipits
(Ängspiplärka), _Anthus pratensis_ and the odd Tree pipit (Trädpiplärka), _Anthus
trivialis_ started to feature in my nocmig recordings. Then in mid September the
recordings turned eerily silent for a week or so. Just the odd White wagtail and
confused Siskin (Grönsiska), _Anthus trivialis_, where recorded. That was until
the night of September 28, when suddenly the flood gates of migrating Redwings
(Redwing), _Turdus iliacus_, and Song thrushes (Song thrush), _Turdus
philomelos_, where opened, and I recorded my first migrating Brambling! Oh, the
simple joys of life!

**Recording 1** In the beginning, a single sharp _tsip_ call of a Song thrush
at a distance, and then the _stiyyf_ calls of two or three passing Redwings.
Recorded at 03:04 on September 28, 2020.

**Recording 2** The squeeky call of a tired Brambling taking a rest on the roof
of our apartment building in central Stockholm. Recorded at 06:28 on September
28, 2020.

To give an example of the impressive night migration over my apartment on
September 28, here is the logfile for that night. I make a note of every migrating
bird that I identify in the recording, but for non-migrating birds, I just make
a note of the first bird I hear. Calls I don't recognize, I call _Strangies_ and
I usually add a short note on the strangie, in case I want to go back to it and
try to figure it out.
