Finding a good mobile app for audio recording of birds is not easy. There are
quite a number of apps to chose from and it is not easy from the descriptions
to understand what features and capabilities each app has. Anyway, these are
my requirements.

MUST:

 * Work on Android.
 * Record WAV-format.
 * Record up to 48 kHz.
 * Record 24 bits.
 * Save and open files.
 * Save/share to Dropbox or other file hosting services as well as other
   installed apps where files can be shared/uploaded.
 * Display sonograms (spectrograms).
 * Have configurable colorstyles for sonograms.

SHOULD:

 * Work on iPhone.
 * Be able to record both video and sound.
 * Have basic editing features like cut.

NICE-TO-HAVE

 * Have editing features for filtering and normalizing.
