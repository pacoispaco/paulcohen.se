Understand the problem, and …

> First, solve the problem. Then, write the code. - John Johnson.

And while you’re coding, consider the following.

> Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs: Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a computer to do. – Donald E. Knuth.

Always KISS!

> There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. And the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. - C.A.R Hoare.

Do not be too clever for your own good.

> Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it. - Brian W. Kernighan.

Digest The Unix philosophy as expressed by Eric S. Raymond.

1. Rule of Modularity: Write simple parts connected by clean interfaces.
2. Rule of Clarity: Clarity is better than cleverness.
1. Rule of Composition: Design programs to be connected to other programs.
3. Rule of Separation: Separate policy from mechanism; separate interfaces from engines.
4. Rule of Simplicity: Design for simplicity; add complexity only where you must.
5. Rule of Parsimony: Write a big program only when it is clear by demonstration that nothing else will do.
6. Rule of Transparency: Design for visibility to make inspection and debugging easier.
7. Rule of Robustness: Robustness is the child of transparency and simplicity.
8. Rule of Representation: Fold knowledge into data so program logic can be stupid and robust.
9. Rule of Least Surprise: In interface design, always do the least surprising thing.
11. Rule of Silence: When a program has nothing surprising to say, it should say nothing.
12. Rule of Repair: When you must fail, fail noisily and as soon as possible.
13. Rule of Economy: Programmer time is expensive; conserve it in preference to machine time.
14. Rule of Generation: Avoid hand-hacking; write programs to write programs when you can.
15. Rule of Optimization: Prototype before polishing. Get it working before you optimize it.
16. Rule of Diversity: Distrust all claims for “one true way”.
17. Rule of Extensibility: Design for the future, because it will be here sooner than you think.

If you ignore everything above, at least consider the following piece of advice.

> Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live. - Martin Golding.
