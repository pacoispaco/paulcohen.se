TBD!

Static websites and Hugo

Styling and Bulma

Versioning the source code and publishing the web site

# Why did I create this website?

Call me Paul. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no prescence on the web or on Internet, and nothing particular to show on a personal home page, I thought I would set about a little and see the blogging and home paging part of the web. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people’s hats off—then, I account it high time to get to surfing the web as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the web. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all people in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards blogging and home pages as I do.

Ok. Enough of that Melvillian paraphrasing. This website exists because:

* I wanted to experiment with Hugo, the static web page tool used to build this
  website, and with Bulma, the CSS framework used to style this website.
* I have a few ideas and opinions on software, the web and other assorted digital and
  technical stuff that may be of interest to others.
* I have a few spare time interests I want to document for my own sake, and
  which also may be of interest to others.
* It's fun to write down sentences of words and see if they make sense.

I've tried a few times before to have a web site and do a blog. Let's see how this try turns out.

My main current interests are:

 * Bird photography and drawing birds.
 * Recording bird songs and creating sonograms.
 * Baysian statistics and its applications in AI and machine learning.
 * NLP (Natural Language Processing) and its applications in AI and machine learning.
 * Gaming historical conflicts in the form of physical board games.
 * Human ingenuity, kindness, compassion, stupidity and cruelty throughout history.
 * Creating sounds with a guitar.

In the real world, I have a family with two wonderful kids, have a job and do my bit of socializing. But I don't write about that here.

# Some legalese to cover my ass

If you believe any texts, images, sounds, movies or any other sequence of bits and bytes on this site encroach on your intellectual "property" rights in any way, please tell me and provide evidence of your claim. I may then humbly beg your pardon, and permantly move any such virtual property to /dev/null, and after that retire back over that invisible digital property fence that I have crossed, but did not see.
